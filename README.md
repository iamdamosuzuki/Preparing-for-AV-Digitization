# Preparing For AV Digitization
This workshop discusses the basics of Audiovisual Preservation, preparing for digitization audiovisual materials

## Description
This workshop will offer participants a general overview of the process of digitizing, migrating, and preserving your audiovisual collections. We will focus on media that are particularly at risk: analog video tapes (VHS, U-matic, Hi8), digital video tapes (MiniDV), and optical disc media (DVDs and CDs). You will learn the essential steps that are needed to digitize and migrate these media effectively, including: How to appropriately identify media for digitization, how to select preservation file formats, how to identify and use the necessary software and hardware for digitization and migration, and how to implement file management and digital preservation practices in order to ensure the successful preservation of your materials.


## Learning Objectives

After taking this course, participants will be able to:
* Identify various at risk audiovisual media formats
* Differentiate between analog and digital audiovisual media
* Understand the difference between the terms “Digitize”, “Migrate”, and “Preserve” and recognize how these concepts are used in audiovisual preservation
* Recognize the strengths and limitations of various digital media file formats
* Confidently make determinations about which preservation file formats are best for their collections
* Utilize open source software to analyze file-based media
* Confidently store and maintain a collection of digitized media files

By the end of this course, participants should have a clear understanding of the fundamental concepts of digitizing, migrating, and preserving audiovisual media. Participants will also be prepared for the second course, which focuses on the hands-on processes of digitizing and migrating audiovisual media.

## Breakout Room Exercise 1: File Use Cases


## Breakout Room Exercise 2: Examining Files

For this exercise you're going to probe a bunch of mystery files and figure out what they are, and which might be a good candidate for a Preservation file. The files you'll need should have been downloaded with repository. They are in the `MysteryMedia` folder.
