# Preparing For AV Digitization
This workshop discusses the basics of Audiovisual Preservation, preparing for digitization audiovisual materials

## Description
This workshop will offer participants a general overview of the process of digitizing, migrating, and preserving your audiovisual collections. We will focus on media that are particularly at risk: analog video tapes (VHS, U-matic, Hi8), digital video tapes (MiniDV), and optical disc media (DVDs and CDs). You will learn the essential steps that are needed to digitize and migrate these media effectively, including: How to appropriately identify media for digitization, how to select preservation file formats, how to identify and use the necessary software and hardware for digitization and migration, and how to implement file management and digital preservation practices in order to ensure the successful preservation of your materials.


## Learning Objectives

After taking this course, participants will be able to:
  * Identify various at risk audiovisual media formats
  * Differentiate between analog and digital audiovisual media
  * Understand the difference between the terms “Digitize”, “Migrate”, and “Preserve” and recognize how these concepts are used in audiovisual preservation
  * Recognize the strengths and limitations of various digital media file formats
  * Confidently make determinations about which preservation file formats are best for their collections
  * Utilize open source software to analyze file-based media
  * Confidently store and maintain a collection of digitized media files

By the end of this course, participants should have a clear understanding of the fundamental concepts of digitizing, migrating, and preserving audiovisual media. Participants will also be prepared for the second course, which focuses on the hands-on processes of digitizing and migrating audiovisual media.

## Pre-Workshop Preparation

Before the workshop you'll need to install the following software:

  * [MediaInfo](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo/Download)
  * [MediaConch](https://mediaarea.net/MediaConch)

Also, download this repository so you have access to the sample files the `MysterMedia` folder

## Exercise 1: File Use Cases

For this exercise we'll discuss a few different files. The instructor will poll the zoom to see which use case people think the files being discussed are best suited for.

  * File 1
    - MP4 / H.264
    - Proprietary. This filetype is property of Apple
    - Highly compressed using lossy compression
    - Deinterlaced (video is optimized for viewing on a computer screen)
    - Audio Panned Center (audio is reorganized for a better listening experience)
    - 720x480
    - 100MB / hour (small enough to send on Google Drive)

    </details>
  * File 2
    - MOV / ProRes
    - Proprietary This filetype is property of Apple
    - Mildly compressed using lossy compression
    - Deinterlaced (video is optimized for viewing on a computer screen)
    - Audio same as tape (audio has not been reorganized to easy viewing/listening)
    - 720x486
    - 30GB / hour (very large file, 30 hours would be one Terabyte)
    - <details>
      <summary>Click to see best use case</summary>
      Production
    </details>
  * File 3
    - MOV / V210
    - Proprietary This filetype is property of Apple
    - Uncompressed
    - Interlaced (video is the same as on the tape)
    - Audio same as tape
    - 720x486
    - 100GB / hr (huge file size, 10 hours is a Terabyte)

  * File 4
    - MKV / FFV1
    - Open Source (file specification is open and free to all)
    - Lossless compression
    - Interlaced (video is the same as on the tape)
    - Audio same as tape
    - 720x486
    - Internal Checksums (the file performs fixit checks on itself during playback and decoding)
    - 40GB / hr (large file size)

## Exercise 2: Preservation Formats

We've discussed how different types of media have different requirements for Preservation Formats. In this exercise we'll discuss different features that Preservation Formats can have and decide which media formats can benefit from these features.

1. Maintain Organization of Original

## Exercise 3: Examining Files

For this exercise you're going to probe a bunch of mystery files and figure out what they are, and which might be a good candidate for a Preservation file. The files you'll need should have been downloaded with repository. They are in the `MysteryMedia` folder.



<details>
  <summary>Each file has a bullet point like this. Don't click it to expand until you've examined the file!</summary>

  When you click on the bullet point it'll expand to show information about the file

<details>
  <summary>Mystery File 01</summary>

  This file is actually a blahblah
